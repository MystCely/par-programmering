# Par-Programmering (Pair Programming Practice)

This repository contains the pair programming assignments completed during **Emne 3** at GET Academy.  
Every other week, students are paired together to solve a small C# challenge in a limited timeframe.

## What Is Par-Programmering?

“Par-programmering” (pair programming) is a collaborative programming style where:

- **One person writes the code** (Driver)
- **The other person guides, reviews, and suggests improvements** (Navigator)
- Roles switch every hour
- Each session lasts around **2 hours total**
- Pairs rotate every other week

This helps develop communication, problem-solving, and cooperative coding skills.

## Purpose of This Repo

The goal is to:

- Practice writing C# under time pressure  
- Improve teamwork and communication  
- Strengthen problem-solving in pairs  
- Learn to structure small projects quickly  
- Develop clean code habits in collaborative environments

## Assignments

Each folder represents a weekly pair programming task.  
Assignments vary, but typically include:

- small console applications  
- logic problems  
- input/output handling  
- basic C# classes and methods  
- simple game or simulation tasks  

## Collaboration Notes

- The commit history may include contributions from different partners.  
- The goal is not perfection, but learning to communicate and solve problems together.  
- Solutions reflect what was achievable within the 1–2 hour time limit.

This repo will continue to grow with new pair programming sessions throughout Emne 3.
